   Container
      A container is an isolated system with a separate root file system and
      operating system userland. The containers share a common operating system
      kernel.

   LVM
      Logical volume manager. The LVM allows to allocate space on block
      devices more dynamically than with traditional partitions. The block
      devices are managed as physical volumes (PVs) that are grouped in volume
      groups (VGs). Space can be allocated as logical volumes (LVs) that can be
      formatted using regular file system tools. LVs can be resized without
      reboot. LVM provides snapshot functionality that is useful for backup and
      upgrade procedures.
