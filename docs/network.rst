.. this page contains information from the IP address list at
   https://wiki.cacert.org/SystemAdministration/IPList


Internet
--------

CAcert has a public Internet IP address range and some of the Internet IP
addresses are mapped to the infrastructure systems.


Intranet
--------

CAcert's infrastructure systems are using a private network range that is
accessible from other CAcert systems.


Internal
--------

The infrastructure host :doc:`infra02` has a local bridge interface that is
used to connect the containers on that machine and allows explicit routing as
well as services that are purely internal and are not reachable from the
Internet or Intranet machines in the IP range mentioned above.
